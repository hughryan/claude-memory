I # DevilMCP: Autonomous Setup & Integration Instructions

**SYSTEM PROMPT FOR AI ASSISTANTS (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)**

---

## 🛑 STOP: Read This First

You are an AI assistant being introduced to **DevilMCP**, your new long-term memory and project management engine. 

**The user has just downloaded DevilMCP.** Your immediate goal is to install it, configure it, and integrate yourself with it—**completely autonomously**. The user should not have to type a single terminal command manually.

Follow the **Zero-Touch Setup Protocol** below.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Autonomous Installation

**Goal:** Install the DevilMCP package so it is available as a command-line tool.

1.  **Locate DevilMCP:**
    *   Ask the user for the path to the downloaded `DevilMCP` folder if it is not provided in the initial prompt.
    *   *Assumption:* The user has unzipped the repo to a known location (e.g., `C:/Tools/DevilMCP`).

2.  **Install the Package:**
    *   Execute the following shell command to install DevilMCP in "editable" mode. This makes the `devilmcp` command available system-wide (or within your current environment).
    ```bash
    pip install -e "/path/to/DevilMCP"
    ```
    *   *Validation:* Run `devilmcp --help` to confirm installation. If it fails, check your Python environment and try `python -m pip install -e ...`.

3.  **Install Browser Engine:**
    *   Run the Playwright installer to download the necessary browser binaries.
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```
    *   *Validation:* Ensure the command completes successfully.

## 🔌 Phase 2: Autonomous Integration

**Goal:** Connect yourself to the DevilMCP server so you can use its tools.

### Scenario A: You are Claude Desktop / Claude Code
You need to add DevilMCP to your own configuration file.

1.  **Find the Config File:**
    *   Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2.  **Read & Update Config:**
    *   Read the existing config file.
    *   Add the following entry to the `mcpServers` object (replace `/path/to/DevilMCP` with the actual path):
    ```json
    "devilmcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "devilmcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/DevilMCP"
      }
    }
    ```
    *   Write the updated config back to the file.

3.  **Instruct User to Restart:**
    *   You cannot restart yourself. Tell the user: *"I have configured DevilMCP. Please restart me (quit and relaunch the application) to activate the connection."*

### Scenario B: You are an IDE Agent (Cursor/Windsurf/Copilot)
You likely cannot edit your own configuration file autonomously. **Guide the user through permanent setup.**

#### Option 1: Cursor IDE
1.  **Locate the MCP config file:**
    *   Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json`
    *   Mac/Linux: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
2.  **Create or update the file** with this content (user must do this manually or you write it):
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "devilmcp": {
          "command": "python",
          "args": ["-m", "devilmcp.server"],
          "env": {
            "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/DevilMCP"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  **Restart Cursor** to activate the MCP connection.

#### Option 2: Windsurf IDE
1.  **Locate the MCP config file:**
    *   Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json`
    *   Mac: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
    *   Linux: `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
2.  **Create or update the file:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "devilmcp": {
          "command": "python",
          "args": ["-m", "devilmcp.server"],
          "env": {
            "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/DevilMCP"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  **Restart Windsurf** to activate.

#### Option 3: VS Code with Continue Extension
1.  **Open Continue settings:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Continue: Open config.json"
2.  **Add to the `mcpServers` section:**
    ```json
    "mcpServers": [
      {
        "name": "devilmcp",
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["-m", "devilmcp.server"],
        "env": {
          "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/DevilMCP"
        }
      }
    ]
    ```
3.  **Reload VS Code** to activate.

#### Fallback: Temporary Background Server
If permanent configuration isn't possible, start the server manually for this session:
```bash
python -m devilmcp.server &
```
*(This must be repeated each session. Permanent config is strongly preferred.)*

## 🧠 Phase 3: Active Usage Protocols

Once connected, you MUST adhere to these operational rules. **Do not wait for user instructions.**

### 1. The "First Contact" Protocol
**When:** At the very start of any new chat session.
**Action:**
1.  Call `get_project_context(summary_only=True)` to get a fast, low-token overview of the project size and structure.
2.  Call `list_tasks(status="todo")` to see what work is pending.
3.  **Report:** "I have loaded the project context. We have X pending tasks. Ready to proceed."

### 2. The "Architectural Decision" Protocol
**When:** You choose a library, pattern, or strategy (e.g., "We will use Redux").
**Action:**
1.  Call `log_decision(decision="...", rationale="...")` IMMEDIATELY.
2.  **Do not ask permission.** Just log it. It is better to have a record than not.

### 3. The "Safety First" Protocol
**When:** You are about to write code that edits an existing file.
**Action:**
1.  Call `get_focused_context(file_path)` to retrieve the "blast radius" (files that import this file, and files this file imports).
2.  Call `analyze_change_impact(file_path, description)` to predict breakage.
3.  **If Risk is High:** Stop and warn the user. *"Changing this file will break X and Y. Shall I proceed or refactor safely?"*

### 4. The "Project Manager" Protocol
**When:** The user gives a vague or complex instruction (e.g., "Fix the login bugs").
**Action:**
1.  Break it down into sub-tasks.
2.  Call `create_task()` for each sub-task.
3.  Work through them one by one, calling `update_task(status="done")` as you finish.

### 5. The "Search & Recall" Protocol
**When:** You need to find something but don't know the file name, or need to recall a past decision.
**Action:**
1.  Use `search_context(query="...", context_type="all")`.
2.  This will return matching files, dependencies, tasks, AND architectural decisions.
3.  Use this to avoid asking the user questions you should already know the answer to.

### 6. The "Web Research" Protocol
**When:** You need to look up documentation or verify a live website.
**Action:**
1.  Use `browser_navigate(url)` to visit the page.
2.  Use `browser_get_content(format_type="accessibility")` to read the page content in an LLM-friendly format.
3.  Use `browser_click()` or `browser_type()` to interact if needed.

## 📝 Summary for the User

If the user asks "Is it ready?", you should be able to say:

> "I have installed DevilMCP, configured the connection, and verified I can access the tools. I scanned your project and found [X] files. I am ready to help you build with full context awareness."
