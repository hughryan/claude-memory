**AI Memory & Decision System** - Give AI agents persistent memory and consistent decision-making with *actual* semantic understanding.

## What's New in v2.15.0

### Iteration 1: Search Quality
- **Configurable hybrid weight**: `DAEM0NMCP_HYBRID_VECTOR_WEIGHT` (0.0-1.0)
- **Result diversity**: `DAEM0NMCP_SEARCH_DIVERSITY_MAX_PER_FILE` limits same-file results
- **Tag inference**: Auto-adds `bugfix`, `tech-debt`, `perf`, `warning` tags

### Iteration 2: Code Entity Fidelity
- **Qualified names**: Entities have `module.Class.method` identifiers
- **Stable IDs**: Line changes don't invalidate entity IDs
- **Import extraction**: Files track their imports for dependency analysis

### Iteration 3: Incremental Indexing
- **File hash tracking**: Only re-parses changed files
- **`index_file_if_changed()`**: Efficient single-file re-indexing
- **FileHash model**: Persists content hashes

### Iteration 4: Performance & UX
- **Parse tree caching**: Avoids re-parsing unchanged files
- **Extended config**: `embedding_model`, `parse_tree_cache_maxsize`
- **Enhanced health**: Code index stats, staleness detection

## What's New in v2.14.0

### Active Working Context (MemGPT-style)
Always-hot memory layer that keeps critical information front and center:
- `set_active_context(memory_id)` - Pin critical memories to active context
- `get_active_context()` - Get all hot memories for current focus
- `remove_from_active_context(memory_id)` - Remove from hot context
- `clear_active_context()` - Clear all hot memories
- Auto-included in `get_briefing()` responses
- Failed decisions auto-activate with high priority
- Max 10 items to prevent context bloat

### Temporal Versioning
Track how memories evolve over time:
- Auto-creates versions on memory creation, outcome recording, relationship changes
- `get_memory_versions(memory_id)` - Get full version history
- `get_memory_at_time(memory_id, timestamp)` - Query historical state
- Enables questions like "What did we believe about X last month?"

### Hierarchical Summarization
GraphRAG-style community detection and layered recall:
- `rebuild_communities()` - Detect clusters by tag co-occurrence
- `list_communities()` - Get summaries for high-level overview
- `get_community_details(id)` - Drill down to member memories
- `recall_hierarchical(topic)` - Layered retrieval: summaries then details
- Auto-generated community names from dominant tags

### Auto Entity Extraction (Cognee-style)
Auto-extract and link code entities from memory content:
- Auto-extracts functions, classes, files, concepts from memories on `remember()`
- `recall_by_entity(name)` - Get all memories mentioning an entity
- `list_entities()` - Most frequently mentioned entities
- `backfill_entities()` - Extract entities from existing memories
- Enables queries like "show everything about UserService"

### Contextual Recall Triggers (Knowledge Graph MCP-style)
Auto-recall memories without explicit calls based on context patterns:
- `add_context_trigger(pattern, topic)` - Define auto-recall rules
- `check_context_triggers(file_path)` - Get triggered context
- `list_context_triggers()` / `remove_context_trigger(id)`
- Supports file patterns, tag matching, entity matching
- Integrated with pre-edit hooks for automatic injection
- MCP Resource: `daem0n://triggered/{file_path}`

  - Strips rationale, context fields; truncates content to 150 chars
  - Focus areas in briefings use condensed mode automatically
  - Inspired by memvid-mind's token efficiency approach

## What's New in v2.11.0

- **Linked Projects (Multi-Repo Support)**: Work across related repositories
  - Link client/server or other related repos for cross-awareness
  - `link_projects()` / `unlink_projects()` / `list_linked_projects()`
  - `recall(include_linked=True)` - Search across linked repos

- **Conflict Detection**: Warns when new decisions contradict past failures
- **Failed Decision Boosting**: Past mistakes surface prominently in recalls
- **File-Level Memories**: Associate memories with specific files
- **Vector Embeddings**: sentence-transformers for enhanced semantic matching

## Why Daem0nMCP?

AI agents start each session fresh. They don't remember:
- What decisions were made and why
- Patterns that should be followed
- Warnings from past mistakes

**Markdown files don't solve this** - the AI has to know to read them and might ignore them.

**Daem0nMCP provides ACTIVE memory** - it surfaces relevant context when the AI asks about a topic, enforces rules before actions, and learns from outcomes.

### What Makes This Different

Unlike keyword-based systems:
- **Semantic matching**: "creating REST endpoint" matches rules about "adding API route"
- **Time decay**: A decision from yesterday matters more than one from 6 months ago
- **Conflict warnings**: "You tried this approach before and it failed"
- **Learning loops**: Record outcomes, and failures get boosted in future recalls

## Quick Start

### The Easy Way (Recommended)

1. Copy `Summon_Daem0n.md` to your project
2. Start a Claude Code session in that project
3. Claude will read the file and perform the summoning ritual automatically

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DasBluEyedDevil/Daem0n-MCP.git ~/Daem0nMCP

# Install
pip install -e ~/Daem0nMCP

# Run the MCP server (Linux/macOS)
python -m daem0nmcp.server

# Run the MCP server (Windows - use HTTP transport)
python ~/Daem0nMCP/start_server.py --port 9876
```

## Installation by Platform

### Linux / macOS (stdio transport)

```bash
# Find your Python path
python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

# Register with Claude Code (replace <PYTHON_PATH>)
claude mcp add daem0nmcp --scope user -- <PYTHON_PATH> -m daem0nmcp.server

# Restart Claude Code
```

### Windows (HTTP transport required)

Windows has a known bug where Python MCP servers using stdio transport hang indefinitely. Use HTTP transport instead:

1. **Start the server** (keep this terminal open):
```bash
python ~/Daem0nMCP/start_server.py --port 9876
```
Or use `start_daem0nmcp_server.bat`

2. **Add to `~/.claude.json`**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "daem0nmcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:9876/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Start Claude Code** (after server is running)

## Usage Examples

### Store a Memory
```python
remember(
    category="decision",  # decision, pattern, warning, or learning
    content="Use JWT tokens instead of sessions",
    rationale="Need stateless auth for horizontal scaling",
    tags=["auth", "architecture"],
    file_path="src/auth/jwt.py"  # optional file association
)
```

### Retrieve Memories
```python
recall("authentication")
# Returns: decisions, patterns, warnings, learnings about auth
# Sorted by: semantic relevance × recency × importance

recall_for_file("src/auth/jwt.py")
# Returns: all memories linked to this file
```

### Create Rules
```python
add_rule(
    trigger="adding new API endpoint",
    must_do=["Add rate limiting", "Write integration test"],
    must_not=["Use synchronous database calls"],
    ask_first=["Is this a breaking change?"]
)
```

### Track Outcomes
```python
record_outcome(memory_id=42, outcome="JWT auth works great", worked=True)
record_outcome(memory_id=43, outcome="Caching caused stale data", worked=False)
# Failed decisions get 1.5x boost in future recalls
```

### Session Start
```python
get_briefing(focus_areas=["authentication", "API"])
# First run: Creates 6-7 memories from project structure, README, manifests, etc.
# Returns: stats, recent decisions, warnings, failed approaches,
# git changes, bootstrap summary, plus pre-fetched context for focus areas
```

### Endless Mode (Token Compression)
```python
# Full recall (default) - ~40KB response
recall("authentication")

# Condensed recall - ~10KB response (75% smaller)
recall("authentication", condensed=True)
# Returns: truncated content, no rationale/context, minimal fields

# Briefings automatically use condensed mode for focus areas
get_briefing(focus_areas=["auth", "database", "api"])
# Focus area results are pre-compressed
```

### Import External Docs
```python
ingest_doc("https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges", "stripe")
# Later: recall("stripe") to retrieve
```

## AI Agent Protocol

The recommended workflow for AI agents:

```
SESSION START
    └─> get_briefing()

BEFORE CHANGES
    └─> context_check("what you're doing")
    └─> recall_for_file("path/to/file.py")

AFTER DECISIONS
    └─> remember(category, content, rationale, file_path)

AFTER IMPLEMENTATION
    └─> record_outcome(memory_id, outcome, worked)
```

See `Summon_Daem0n.md` for the complete protocol (with ritual theme for fun).

## Claude Code Integration

### Hooks (Auto-Reminders)

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo '[Daem0n] Check memories before modifying'"
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo '[Daem0n] Consider calling remember()'"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Passive Capture Hooks

For fully automatic memory capture, enable all hooks in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write|NotebookEdit",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$HOME/Daem0nMCP/hooks/daem0n_pre_edit_hook.py\""
      }]
    }],
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$HOME/Daem0nMCP/hooks/daem0n_post_edit_hook.py\""
      }]
    }],
    "Stop": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 \"$HOME/Daem0nMCP/hooks/daem0n_stop_hook.py\""
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**What each hook does:**
- **Pre-edit**: Shows warnings, patterns, and past decisions for files before you modify them
- **Post-edit**: Suggests calling `remember()` when you make significant changes
- **Stop**: Auto-extracts decisions from Claude's responses and creates memories

### Protocol Skill

For Superpowers users, a skill is included at `.claude/skills/daem0nmcp-protocol/SKILL.md` that enforces the memory protocol.

## How It Works

### TF-IDF Similarity
Instead of simple keyword matching, Daem0nMCP builds TF-IDF vectors for all stored memories and queries. This means:
- "authentication" matches memories about "auth", "login", "OAuth"
- Rare terms (like project-specific names) get higher weight
- Common words are automatically de-emphasized

### Memory Decay
```
weight = e^(-λt) where λ = ln(2)/half_life_days
```
Default half-life is 30 days. A 60-day-old memory has ~25% weight.
Patterns and warnings are permanent (no decay).

### Conflict Detection
When storing a new memory, it's compared against recent memories:
- If similar content failed before → warning about the failure
- If it matches an existing warning → warning surfaced
- If highly similar content exists → potential duplicate flagged

### Failed Decision Boosting
Memories with `worked=False` get a 1.5x relevance boost in recalls.
Warnings get a 1.2x boost. This ensures past mistakes surface prominently.

## Data Storage

Each project gets isolated storage at:
```
<project_root>/.daem0nmcp/storage/daem0nmcp.db
```

### Legacy Migration
If upgrading from DevilMCP, data is automatically migrated from `.devilmcp/` to `.daem0nmcp/`.

## Configuration

Environment variables (prefix: `DAEM0NMCP_`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAEM0NMCP_PROJECT_ROOT` | `.` | Project root path |
| `DAEM0NMCP_STORAGE_PATH` | auto | Override storage location |
| `DAEM0NMCP_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level |

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Check a file against memories and rules
python -m daem0nmcp.cli check <filepath>

# Get session briefing/statistics
python -m daem0nmcp.cli briefing

# Scan for TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
python -m daem0nmcp.cli scan-todos [--auto-remember] [--path PATH]

# Index code entities (Phase 2)
python -m daem0nmcp.cli index [--path PATH] [--patterns **/*.py **/*.ts ...]

# Run database migrations (usually automatic)
python -m daem0nmcp.cli migrate [--backfill-vectors]
```

### Enforcement Commands

```bash
# Check staged files (used by pre-commit hook)
python -m daem0nmcp.cli pre-commit [--interactive]

# Show pending decisions and blocking issues
python -m daem0nmcp.cli status

# Record outcome for a decision
python -m daem0nmcp.cli record-outcome <id> "<outcome>" --worked|--failed

# Install git hooks
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-hooks [--force]

# Remove git hooks
python -m daem0nmcp.cli uninstall-hooks
```

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output and `--project-path` to specify the project root.

## Upgrading

Upgrading Daem0n-MCP is straightforward:

### 1. Update the Code

```bash
# If installed from source (recommended)
cd ~/Daem0nMCP && git pull && pip install -e .

# If installed via pip
pip install --upgrade daem0nmcp
```

**Important:** The `pip install -e .` step is required to install all dependencies:
- `qdrant-client` - Vector database for semantic search
- `watchdog` - File watching for proactive notifications
- `plyer` - Desktop notifications
- `tree-sitter-language-pack` - Multi-language code parsing (Python 3.14 compatible)

All dependencies are required for full functionality.

### 2. Restart Claude Code

After updating, restart Claude Code to load the new MCP tools.

### 3. Migrations Run Automatically

Database migrations are applied automatically when any MCP tool runs. The first time you use `get_briefing()`, `remember()`, or any other tool after upgrading, the database schema is updated.

No manual migration step required.

### 4. Install Enforcement Hooks

Pre-commit hooks block commits when decisions lack outcomes:

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli install-hooks
```

### 5. Index Your Codebase

Enable code understanding by indexing your project:

```bash
python -m daem0nmcp.cli index
```

This parses your code with tree-sitter (supports Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP) and enables semantic code search via `find_code()` and impact analysis via `analyze_impact()`.

## Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run tests (432 tests)
pytest tests/ -v --asyncio-mode=auto

# Run server directly
python -m daem0nmcp.server

# Run HTTP server (Windows)
python start_server.py --port 9876
```
