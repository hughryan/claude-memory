DevilMCP is designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code. Add this configuration to your Claude Code config file:

**Location:**
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devilmcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/DevilMCP/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO",

## Example Workflows

### Starting a New Task

```python
# 1. Start a thought session
start_thought_session(
    session_id="feature-auth-2024-01",
    context={"task": "Implement user authentication", "project": "MyApp"}
)

# 2. Analyze project structure
project_context = analyze_project_structure("/path/to/project")

# 3. Log your thinking
log_thought_process(
    thought="Need to implement JWT-based authentication",
    category="analysis",
    reasoning="Current system has no auth; JWT is stateless and scalable",
    confidence=0.8
)

# 4. Check for reasoning gaps
gaps = analyze_reasoning_gaps()
# Review suggestions and address gaps
```

### Making a Code Change

```python
# 1. Analyze file dependencies
deps = track_file_dependencies("/path/to/file.py", "/path/to/project")

# 2. Analyze change impact
impact = analyze_change_impact(
    file_path="/path/to/file.py",
    change_description="Refactor authentication logic",
    dependencies=deps
)

# 3. Analyze cascade risk
risk = analyze_cascade_risk(
    target="/path/to/file.py",
    change_type="refactor",
    context={"affects": "authentication"}
)

# 4. Get safe change suggestions
suggestions = suggest_safe_changes(
    target="/path/to/file.py",
    proposed_change="Refactor to use JWT tokens"
)

# 5. Log the decision
decision = log_decision(
    decision="Refactor auth to use JWT tokens",
    rationale="Improves scalability and security",
    context={"risk": risk, "impact": impact},
    alternatives_considered=["Session-based auth", "OAuth2"],
    expected_impact="Improved performance, easier horizontal scaling",
    risk_level="medium",
    tags=["authentication", "refactor"]
)

# 6. Log the change
change = log_change(
    file_path="/path/to/file.py",
    change_type="refactor",
    description="Refactor to JWT-based authentication",
    rationale="Improve scalability and security",
    affected_components=["auth", "api", "middleware"],
    risk_assessment=risk,
    rollback_plan="Keep old auth code as fallback for 2 weeks"
)

# 7. After implementation, update status
update_change_status(
    change_id=change["id"],
    status="implemented",
    actual_impact="Performance improved by 15%, no issues detected"
)

update_decision_outcome(
    decision_id=decision["id"],
    outcome="Successfully implemented",
    actual_impact="Better than expected - 15% perf improvement",
    lessons_learned="JWT implementation was smoother with proper testing"
)
```

### Learning from History

```python
# Query similar past decisions
past_decisions = query_decisions(
    query="authentication",
    tags=["refactor"],
    limit=5
)

# Review cascade failures
cascade_history = query_cascade_history(
    severity="high",
    limit=10
)

# Get comprehensive statistics
stats = get_mcp_statistics()
print(f"Decision tracking rate: {stats['decisions']['outcome_tracking_rate']}")
print(f"Changes with issues: {stats['changes']['issue_rate']}")
```

## Best Practices for AI Agents

### 1. Always Start with Context
Before making any changes, use `analyze_project_structure` and `get_project_context` to understand the full picture.

### 2. Log All Decisions
Use `log_decision` for EVERY significant decision. This builds institutional knowledge and helps avoid repeating mistakes.

### 3. Analyze Before Changing
Always use `analyze_change_impact` and `analyze_cascade_risk` BEFORE making changes. This is your early warning system for short-sighted decisions.

### 4. Track Your Thinking
Use thought process tools throughout your work. `analyze_reasoning_gaps` helps catch blind spots.

### 5. Update Outcomes
After implementing changes, always use `update_change_status` and `update_decision_outcome` to close the feedback loop.

### 6. Learn from History
Regularly query past decisions and changes to learn from experience.

### 7. Check for Conflicts
Use `detect_change_conflicts` before implementing changes to avoid stepping on other work.

## Data Storage

DevilMCP stores its data in the configured `STORAGE_PATH` (default: `./storage`):

- **Core Data (SQLite):** `devilmcp.db` stores all project data including decisions, changes, tools, tasks, workflows, thought sessions, and project context analysis. This ensures ACID compliance and robust querying capabilities.

All data is persisted to disk and loaded/connected on server start.

## Database Migration (Upgrading from v1)

If you have data from an older version of DevilMCP stored in JSON files (`decisions.json`, etc.), you can migrate it to the new SQLite database:

1. Ensure your server is stopped.
2. Run the migration script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/migrate_json_to_sqlite.py
   ```
   This will look for JSON files in your storage directory and import them into `devilmcp.db`.

## Configuration

DevilMCP supports optional configuration via a `tools.toml` file in the project root. This allows you to pre-define custom CLI tools that the agent can use. See `tools.toml.example` for a template.

## Architecture

DevilMCP is built with a modular architecture:

```
server.py           # FastMCP server with tool registration
├── context_manager.py     # Project context and structure analysis
├── decision_tracker.py    # Decision logging and analysis
├── change_analyzer.py     # Change impact assessment
├── cascade_detector.py    # Cascade failure detection
└── thought_processor.py   # Thought process management
```

Each module is independent and can be extended or customized as needed.

## Advanced Features

### Dependency Graphs

With NetworkX installed, DevilMCP can build and analyze complex dependency graphs:

```python
# Build graph from all tracked dependencies
deps_dict = {
    "/path/to/file1.py": track_file_dependencies("/path/to/file1.py"),
    "/path/to/file2.py": track_file_dependencies("/path/to/file2.py"),
    # ... more files
}

graph_stats = build_dependency_graph(deps_dict)

# Analyze specific component
deps = detect_dependencies(
    target="/path/to/critical/file.py",
    depth=5,
    direction="both"
)
```

### Risk-Based Decision Making

DevilMCP tracks risk levels across decisions and changes:

```python
# Get all high-risk decisions
high_risk = query_decisions(risk_level="high", limit=20)

# Analyze patterns
stats = get_decision_statistics()
print(f"Risk distribution: {stats['risk_distribution']}")
```

### Session-Based Reasoning

Track entire work sessions with full reasoning chains:

```python
# Start session
start_thought_session("bug-fix-123", {"issue": "#123"})

# Log thoughts throughout work
log_thought_process("Found root cause in parser", "analysis", "...")
log_thought_process("Considering two fix approaches", "hypothesis", "...")
log_thought_process("Approach A might break edge cases", "concern", "...")

# Check for gaps
gaps = analyze_reasoning_gaps()

# End with summary
end_thought_session(
    "bug-fix-123",
    summary="Fixed parser bug with minimal impact",
    outcomes=["Bug fixed", "Tests passing", "No regressions"]
)

# Review later
summary = get_session_summary("bug-fix-123")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify Python version is 3.8 or higher: `python --version`
- Check that the port is not in use: `netstat -an | grep 8080`

### Storage errors
- Ensure the storage directory is writable
- Check disk space
- Verify file permissions on the storage directory

### Import errors
- Activate the virtual environment
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall`
